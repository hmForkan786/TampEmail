# API Convention

Status: proposed implementation convention, established by Prompt 293.

This document records the convention supported by the current codebase. It does not claim that the API is implemented.

## Evidence and decisions

The project is Laravel 12 with PHP 8.2 and Filament 5. `composer.json` does not include `laravel/sanctum` or another token-authentication package. `config/auth.php` defines only the `web` session guard. The `User` model is an authenticatable Eloquent model, and the users migration contains sessions and password-reset storage but no API-token storage.

The project already has an `ApiKey` model, migration, DTOs, actions, services, and repositories. API keys are hashed, owned by a user, optionally permission-scoped, revocable, expirable, and rate-limited. However, no middleware currently authenticates an API key, and no API routes or controllers exist.

Therefore:

- API routes will use `/api/v1`.
- The project API will use its existing first-party `ApiKey` domain rather than Sanctum, because no Sanctum package is installed and the existing domain already models the required credential lifecycle.
- Implementing the API-key guard/middleware, token issuance, permission checks, and migrations is deferred to a later implementation prompt.
- Sanctum installation is not part of this convention task. If the project later chooses Sanctum, this document must be revised before implementation.

The project specification requires versioned endpoints, explicit authorization, safe public errors, defined rate limits, and snake_case API JSON fields. Those requirements are authoritative for the conventions below.

## Authentication flow

Future requests should authenticate with:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <plain_api_key>
```

The future API-key middleware must:

1. Extract the bearer token without logging it.
2. Derive the stored key hash using the project’s API-key hashing policy.
3. Resolve an available key: not revoked and not expired.
4. Resolve the owning user and reject soft-deleted or inactive users.
5. Attach both the authenticated user and the authenticated API-key context to the request.
6. Record safe usage metadata only; never persist the plaintext token.
7. Apply the key’s configured rate limit together with the global `config/abuse.php` API limit.

Unauthenticated API routes are not permitted for MailServer administration.

## Token abilities and scope names

Use stable, lowercase, colon-delimited permission names stored in the existing `api_keys.permissions` JSON field:

| Scope | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mail_servers:read` | List and show platform MailServer records (operator/platform keys) |
| `mail_servers:write` | Create and update platform MailServer records (operator/platform keys) |
| `mail_servers:admin` | Administrative MailServer operations; implies other `mail_servers:*` scopes |
| `inboxes:read` | Read owned inboxes |
| `inboxes:write` | Create/update owned inboxes |

`mail_servers:admin` does not implicitly grant unrelated module permissions. `AuthenticatedApiKeyContext` already allows `mail_servers:admin` to satisfy other `mail_servers:*` scope checks. These scopes are not ordinary end-user product grants; see `docs/MAIL_SERVER_OWNERSHIP_POLICY.md` and `docs/PLATFORM_OPERATOR_POLICY.md`.

Platform operator eligibility (future `users.platform_role`: `user` | `operator` | `admin`) gates who may be issued `mail_servers:read` / `write` / `admin`. Ordinary users default to `user`. `mail_servers:admin` requires `admin`. Suspended, banned, pending, or soft-deleted users are never verified operators. Demotion must make privileged keys unusable.

## Authorization and ownership

MailServer ownership is decided in `docs/MAIL_SERVER_OWNERSHIP_POLICY.md` (Prompt 317).

**Decision: Option A — platform-managed global MailServers.** There is no `user_id` / `team_id` / tenant owner on `mail_servers`. Inbox ownership (`inboxes.user_id`) is separate from MailServer infrastructure assignment (`inboxes.mail_server_id`). Pool access is entitlement-controlled (`mail_server_pools`) for authenticated users and config-controlled (`PUBLIC_MAIL_SERVER_POOL`) for anonymous provisioning.

MailServer API endpoints are an operator/platform surface, not an ordinary user product API. Do not expose them through end-user inbox scopes. Never infer ownership from hostname, pool key, provider, or request input.

| Caller | MailServer read | MailServer write | Cross-tenant MailServer rows |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Anonymous | deny | deny | n/a (no tenant ownership) |
| Authenticated API key without `mail_servers:*` | deny | deny | n/a |
| Authenticated API key with `mail_servers:read` | allow (global catalog; operator keys) | deny | n/a |
| Authenticated API key with `mail_servers:write` | as needed for write | allow (global catalog; operator keys) | n/a |
| Authenticated API key with `mail_servers:admin` | allow | allow | n/a (implies other `mail_servers:*`) |
| API key with only `inboxes:*` | deny | deny | n/a |

Tenant-owned MailServers (Option B) require an approved product decision, migration, and a revision of this document before implementation.

## HTTP status and error responses

API JSON fields and error codes use `snake_case`.

MailServer API success and error envelopes are standardized (Prompt 302).

Success responses use a stable envelope:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "pool_key": "primary",
    "max_inboxes": 100
  }
}
```

Collection responses use `data` plus pagination `meta` (no top-level `links`):

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "per_page": 15,
    "total": 0,
    "last_page": 1
  }
}
```

Errors use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_failed",
    "message": "The given data was invalid.",
    "details": {
      "max_inboxes": ["The max inboxes field must be at least 1."]
    }
  }
}
```

| Status | Code | Use |
|---:|---|---|
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Missing, invalid, expired, or revoked API credential |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Valid credential lacks required scope or ownership |
| 404 | `not_found` | Resource is absent or intentionally hidden by ownership policy |
| 409 | `conflict` | State or uniqueness conflict |
| 422 | `validation_failed` | Request validation failure (`error.details` is field-wise) |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | API or key rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | `server_error` | Safe generic unexpected failure (no internal exception text in production) |

API-key middleware already returns the `error.code` / `error.message` envelope for 401/403 and must not be altered by resource formatting. Validation and not-found responses include `error.details` (empty object when unused). Plain API tokens must never appear in error bodies.

Do not reveal whether an inaccessible MailServer exists. Ownership failures should normally resolve as `404`; missing scope without resource lookup may resolve as `403`.

## Pagination and routes

Use Laravel pagination parameters `page` and `per_page`, bounded by the endpoint. Response metadata uses the envelope above.

Route names use dot notation and the versioned prefix:

```text
api.v1.mail-servers.index
api.v1.mail-servers.show
api.v1.mail-servers.store
api.v1.mail-servers.update
```

Future MailServer blueprint:

```text
GET    /api/v1/mail-servers
GET    /api/v1/mail-servers/{mail_server}
POST   /api/v1/mail-servers
PUT    /api/v1/mail-servers/{mail_server}
PATCH  /api/v1/mail-servers/{mail_server}
```

Use UUID route binding and never expose an unscoped model lookup before authorization.

## Field and DTO mapping

The external API follows the project’s documented snake_case convention:

```text
pool_key     → CreateMailServerData::poolKey / UpdateMailServerData::poolKey
max_inboxes  → CreateMailServerData::maxInboxes / UpdateMailServerData::maxInboxes
```

`max_inboxes: null` means unlimited capacity. An absent update field means “leave unchanged.” Explicit nullable clearing remains a separate DTO concern and must not be silently introduced by endpoint code.

MailServer API resources emit snake_case fields consistently, including `pool_key`, `max_inboxes`, `is_active`, `max_connections`, `timeout_seconds`, `last_health_check_at`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. An audit found no frontend or internal API consumer depending on the previous camelCase response names, so this is a compatible standardization for the current project state.

## Controller data flow

Controllers must remain thin:

```text
API request
  → FormRequest validation
  → DTO::fromArray($request->validated())
  → Controller
  → MailServerService
  → MailServer Action
  → Repository
  → Database
  → MailServerResource
  → success envelope
```

Controllers must not implement pool selection, capacity calculation, persistence mapping, or authorization decisions. Authorization belongs in the future API-key middleware and policy/authorization layer.

## Filament alignment

Filament is an authenticated admin surface under the existing `admin` panel. A future MailServer Resource must follow Option A: platform-managed catalog under the same operator capability boundary as the MailServer API. It must not treat Filament access as permission to bypass API policy. Admin-only operations should use `mail_servers:admin` or the project’s eventual equivalent capability.

## Required follow-up implementation

Historical checklist from the convention’s introduction (several items are already implemented):

1. API-key bearer authentication middleware/guard and request user context.
2. API-key issuance/revocation flow and secure hash verification policy.
3. Scope checking middleware or policy integration.
4. MailServer ownership decision: **resolved as Option A** (platform-managed; see `docs/MAIL_SERVER_OWNERSHIP_POLICY.md`). No ownership schema change is required for that baseline.
5. Versioned API route registration and controller base response handling.
6. A resource implementation that emits snake_case fields, correcting any prior camelCase mapping if that mapping is not intentionally retained.
7. Feature tests for authentication, scope checks, error envelopes, pagination, and rate limits.

No API route, controller, middleware, policy, token migration, or package installation is part of documentation-only prompts.

## API-key generation format

Newly issued keys use `te_live_<base64url-random-secret>`, with 43 cryptographically random URL-safe characters. The stored `key_prefix` is the first 16 token characters. The stored `key_hash` is `v1:` followed by an HMAC-SHA256 digest of the complete plaintext token using the dedicated `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` value.

`API_KEY_HASH_SECRET` is required; there is no `APP_KEY` fallback. Existing records are not rewritten and remain legacy/unresolvable until a separately approved compatibility policy exists. Plaintext is returned only through the creation-only issuance result and is never persisted, serialized from the model, or logged. Hash verification uses a timing-safe comparison.

## Anonymous mail-server pool configuration

Anonymous/public inbox provisioning uses a dedicated configuration contract documented in `docs/ANONYMOUS_MAIL_SERVER_POOL.md`.

- Environment variable: `PUBLIC_MAIL_SERVER_POOL`
- Config key: `inbox.public_mail_server_pool`
- Empty or unset values disable anonymous mail-server assignment.
- Only servers whose `pool_key` exactly matches the configured value may be used; `pool_key = null` servers are never eligible.
- Authenticated entitlement pool resolution (`mail_server_pools`) is unchanged and independent of this setting.

## Platform operator capability

MailServer API scopes are operator/admin-gated per `docs/PLATFORM_OPERATOR_POLICY.md` (Prompt 319):

- Recommended model: `users.platform_role` ∈ {`user`, `operator`, `admin`} (default `user`; not yet migrated).
- `mail_servers:read` / `mail_servers:write` → verified `operator` or `admin` owners only.
- `mail_servers:admin` → verified `admin` only.
- Missing capability, inactive lifecycle, or demotion → fail closed; privileged keys must not remain usable.
- Pool entitlements never grant operator capability.

## API-key ownership policy

### Decision

The supported policy is **Option A: user-owned API keys only**. The `api_keys.user_id` foreign key is required and cascades on user deletion; `ApiKey::user()` is the ownership relationship. There is currently no separate system-owner, team-owner, or platform-owner representation.

Every persisted API key therefore requires a valid user owner. Administrative or background issuance may issue a key on behalf of a specific user, but administrator status does not remove the owner or bypass that user's API-key quota.

### User and payload resolution

- If `$user` is supplied, its primary key must match the payload `userId`; a mismatch is rejected.
- If `$user` is absent and `userId` is supplied, the user is resolved from the database and locked before quota evaluation and insertion.
- A missing, empty, or invalid `userId` is not a supported system-key request. It must fail closed before persistence rather than rely on the database foreign-key error.
- Owner quota applies to every supported key. Missing entitlement or a `null` limit means unlimited; revoked keys do not consume quota, while expired but non-revoked keys continue to consume quota.

### System-key ambiguity and future work

The current nullable-looking `$user = null` path is an API ambiguity, not a valid unowned-key capability: a true unowned record cannot satisfy the non-null `user_id` schema constraint. It must not be exposed as a system-key issuance path.

If explicit system keys are later required, the implementation sequence is: choose an ownership representation and migration/backfill strategy; define an authenticated admin actor and audit trail; define separate quota, scope, rotation, revocation, and serialization rules; then add authorization and relational concurrency tests. Existing user-owned records must remain compatible, and no existing record should be rehashed or reclassified by assumption.

Until that design is approved and implemented, API-key creation, issuance, and API authentication should assume a valid user owner and reject ownerless requests.
